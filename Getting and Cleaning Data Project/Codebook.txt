setup: we need to merge the training and test data set from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" experiment, and transform the data such that the final output dat comply to the tidy standard and with descriptive field names

Codebook:
the subject, activity and measure data are loaded and merged into sub, lab and all_raw for later processing.
load the feature names into features variable and then use it as variable names for the all_raw data set.
select the mean and std related variables based on the names we got with the feature data applied to all_raw.
load activity label description into activity_labels.
use merge function to link activity id and activity label description in variable mergedData.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names through a series of gsub function call.
produce the object with all the right variable names and data with cbind names: all_data_mean_std_only.
use melt and ddply to ransform and summarize the data into tidy compliant format final_output.
write the tidy file to a text file.
